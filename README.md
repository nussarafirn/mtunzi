mtunzi: a programmable approach to software-defined network access control and captive networking for low-resource setting


### **What is *mtunzi?***
*Mtunzi* is a system for software-defined network access control and captive networking for low-resource settings. It is aimed toward the networking needs of small WISPs and community networking operators. With mtunzi we are simply trying to use a software-defined approach to 
1. registering and authenticating switches, 
2. authenticating hosts and users, and 
3. dynamically managing hosts and users. 

The goal is to design and develop a network access control and authorization mechanism for SDN networks.
